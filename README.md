Repository for front end templates
Welcome to the Hacktoberfest Portfolio Template Repository! This is a collaborative project aimed at helping participants create simple, customizable portfolio templates. We invite you to contribute by creating your own portfolio template that pulls information from a configuration file.
üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

Each contributor will create their own folder within the templates directory. Inside this folder, you should include:

    A HTML/CSS/JS/ etc template for the portfolio.
    A config file (e.g., config.json, config.yaml) containing the details like name, bio, projects, and contact information.

You should make a folder with your profolio title and in readme inside your portfolio write about the portfolio and the things which you take from config file like githun, social meadia etc.
